# Let Risk Be your Guide

Shortly after the first stakeholder meeting on a new software project, I always feel a giant pit grow in my stomach. If I didn’t have that feeling, then I would be worried. Software worth building always has risks.

A risk is something bad that might happen in the future. If it already happened, then it’s called a problem.

Software architecture design is an exercise in risk reduction. Every time you think, I’ve got a bad feeling about this, it’s a sign there’s a risk looming nearby.

Risk aspects: condiction, impact, probability, time frame

Engineering risks help us decide what to design. Design mindsets help us devise a strategy to decrease the risk. When facing a risk that must be reduced, first decide which parts of the risk you can address—condition, impact, probability, or time frame. Next, choose a design mindset. 

Risks are the GPS for our design process. They tell us where we are, where we’re going, and how much we have left to design. With each loop through the think-do-check cycle discussed, think about the risks and use them to decide what to do next.
