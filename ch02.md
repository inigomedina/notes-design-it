# Design Thnking Fundamentals

To help you perform this challenging task, you’ll learn a creative and analytical approach to problem solving that puts humans at the center of attention called design thinking. Focusing on the people affected by your design decisions helps you concentrate on the exact problems that must be solved. It also grounds your solution exploration by reminding you that your purpose is to build software that helps people.

Design thinking is less a process and more a way of thinking about problems and solutions from the perspective of the people affected by them. 

4 principles of design:

1.  Human Rule
    All design is social in nature.

2.  Ambiguity Rule
    Preserve ambiguity.

3.  Redesign Rule
    All design is redesign.

4.  Tangibility Rule
    Make ideas tangible to facilitate communication.


The acronym of these 4 principles is called HART.


## Design gor Humans

Design is an inherently human-focused endeavor.  We design software for people.  We design software with people.  Every design decision in the architecture helps individuals in some way.  Every design decision must be understood by and shared with other humans.

The Human rule also reminds us that architects are not separated from our teams. Building software is an intensely social activity.

Empathizing with the humans who directly and indirectly interact with the architecture makes us a better designer, communicator, and leader.


## Preserve Ambiguity

Ambiguity in engineering is dangerous.

A minimalist architecture only shows how high-priority quality attributes are achieved and reduces risks for promoting those quality attributes. All other design decisions are left open for downstream designers to determine.

[Less is more](http://www.itu.dk/~jacok/VIPS/nils/01041178.pdf)


## Design is Redesign

[A pattern language](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf)

The redesign rule encourages us to look to think about what we already know by exploring patterns and past designs.

When designing software architectures, we’ll spend more time refining existing designs than we’ll be creating new ones.


## Make the Architecture Tangible

f we want to share an architecture with others, then we need to make it real in a way code by itself will not allow.

There are many ways to make architecture tangible. Draw it. Make it come alive in the code you write. Build prototypes that let people experience structures and quality attributes. Create simple models that show how some part of the architecture works. Create relatable metaphors. Act out parts of the control flow of the system.

The tangibility rule is closely related to the Human rule. Humans must be able to relate to ideas to internalize them. The only way to share an architecture is to make it tangible.


## Adopt a Design Mindset

A design mindset is a way of thinking about the world so that we focus our attention on the right details at the right time.

There are four design mindsets: understand, explore, make, and evaluate.

UNDERSTAND - EXPLORE - MAKE - EVALUATE


### Understand

In the understand mindset we actively seek information from stakeholders and work to describe the problem. The understand mindset is as much about requirements as it is empathy. To understand the problem, we must learn about the people who will be touched by our system and what they need.

To understand the problem, we’ll need to investigate business goals and quality attributes that are important to our stakeholders. We’ll also have to learn how our team operates and get a deeper sense of the priorities and trade-offs among design decisions.


### Explore

When we explore, we create multiple design concepts and identify engineering approaches for solving some aspect of a problem.

When we’re planning the architecture, we’ll spend a lot of time in the exploration mindset, but this mindset is also useful when working with stakeholders.


### Make

In the make mindset we turn our design concepts into real-world artifacts.

The most common ways we make architecture real is by creating models. Making goes way beyond box and line diagrams. You can make the architecture real by building prototypes, writing documents, crunching numbers, and a variety of other approaches.

The make mindset is useful for communicating our plans. We’ll also make the architecture real as we build the system—for example, by organizing our code so that it’s possible to see module structures in the architecture. Making is also an excellent way to push your team out of analysis paralysis.


### Evaluate

How do you know if a design decision will solve the problem? When we embrace the evaluate mindset, we determine the fitness of our design decisions relative to our current understanding.

Evaluation is not an all or none proposition.


Using design mindsets requires a process with a tight feedback loop so we can quickly move from one mindset to the next.


## Think, Do, Check

For us to keep tabs on this ever changing landscape, we need a design approach with a tight feedback loop that gives us the opportunity to change our mindsets often.

There are three steps in our approach: think, do, and check. Each iteration of the think-do-check cycle focuses on a particular design mindset.


### Iterate to Learn

An iteration can be as brief as a few minutes or as long as a few days. We prefer shorter cycles over longer ones, but sometimes more time is required for in-depth research.

Think
What do we hope to learn? What questions do we need answered? What are our top risks? Thinking involves creating a plan to learn what we need to answer specific questions or reduce risks.

Do
Execute the plan. Create something tangible that quickly and cheaply uncovers information needed to check our thinking and share our ideas.

Check
Critically examine what we accomplished during the do step so we can decide our next move. The insights coming out of the check step tell us what to do next. Repeat at the think step.

**A software system is never finished; it is only released.**

Mindsets shift frequently and quickly. During a single conversation, we might change mindsets several times.

Experienced architects are often unaware that they attack architecture from varying perspectives. They fly by instinct and adopt different mindsets intuitively (thanks to years of practice). Awareness of the four design mindsets gives us new techniques for getting out of a rut.


# Devise a Design Strategy

**Designing software architecture always feels a bit chaotic.**

With a solid design strategy, we can feel our way through the mists of uncertainty.

Design thinking is perfect for finding solutions to complex problems. Instead of trying to solve the problem perfectly on the first try, design thinking emphasizes learning and experimentation.


## Find a design that satisfies

In a rational world, we’d fully define the problem before designing a perfect architecture to solve it. Too bad we don’t live in a perfect, rational world.

[The sciences of the artificial](https://monoskop.org/images/9/9c/Simon_Herbert_A_The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial_3rd_ed.pdf)

Herbert Simon coined the term bounded rationality to describe the theoretical barrier created by limits in time, money, skills, and knowledge that make rational design challenging for complex problems such as software architecture.

**Treat solutions as experiments.**

 Think of every potential solution as an experiment to be validated. The sooner, faster, and cheaper we can validate (or invalidate) our hypotheses, the sooner we’ll find the right combination of structures that will help our stakeholders and the sooner our stakeholders will gain value from our designs.

 **Focus on reducing risks.**

 Architects must constantly worry about what could go wrong and design for these scenarios. We can use risk to help us decide what to design next.

 **Work to simplify problems.**

 Simple problems often have simple solutions. 

 There are many ways to simplify the problem. Reducing the number of stakeholders will decrease the variety of competing perspectives influencing the system. Adding or removing constraints, or focusing on a subset of the problem can reduce complexity. Identifying the routine problems makes it easier to focus on redesign. Routine problems have a known solution so we can start with pattern catalogs and apply our collective experience when exploring solutions.

 **Iterate quicly to learn quickly.**

 The faster we learn, the more we can explore, and the greater confidence we’ll have in our solutions. If we’re wrong, let’s find out as quickly as possible. Failing fast means learning fast.

 **Think about the problem and solution at the same time.**

 In Notes on the Synthesis of Form [Ale64], Christopher Alexander shows how problems are always defined with a solution in mind. The boundary around a problem is created by the solutions that could potentially solve it. To understand the problem, we must explore solutions. To do a better job of exploring solutions, we must improve our understanding of the problem. Designing software architecture requires us to think about problems and solutions simultaneously. Writing some code early in the design process is one strategy for dealing with the reciprocal relationship between problems and solutions.
