# Empathize with Stakeholders

Knowing what problem to solve is sometimes easier said than done. Since we create software to help people, we must understand the people whose lives will be affected by the software we make to understand the problem thoroughly. The better we empathize with their needs, the better we’ll see and understand the real problems that need to be solved.

We call people with an interest or concern in our software stakeholders.

Empathy is the engine that drives design. When you empathize with the people affected by your software, then you’ll make better software.
